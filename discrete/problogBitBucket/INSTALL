Installation instructions
=========================

ProbLog 2.1 should work out of the box on most systems with Python installed.

Mac OSX and most Linux installations have Python pre-installed.
If Python is not yet installed on your system you can obtain it from 
    
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
    
For better performance you can also run ProbLog with PyPy:

    http://pypy.org/download.html

ProbLog is compatible with Python 2.7+ and 3.2+.

ProbLog's evaluation is based on knowledge compilation tools.
By default it uses dsharp [https://bitbucket.org/haz/dsharp].

It also supports two other tools:
    * C2D Compiler (NNF) [http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/c2d/]
    * Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDD) [http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/sdd/]
    
It is recommended to install one of these alternatives (especially for Mac users).

Linux (64-bit)
--------------

SDD
+++

1. Run `python problog-cli.py install`

Note: this installation requires 'python-dev' (i.e. Python.h)

Usage: 
ProbLog will automatically use SDDs from now on.
If you want to use d-DNNFs you can use add the command line options -k nnf.
